# SEO Audit & Optimization Report: طلا آنلاین (Gold Online)

## 1. Executive Summary
This report details the findings of an SEO audit performed on the "طلا آنلاین" website. The optimization focused on improving search engine visibility, social media presence, and technical compliance with modern SEO standards, specifically for the Persian market.

## 2. Detailed Audit & Recommendations

### Core SEO Elements
*   **Heading Hierarchy:**
    *   *Issue:* Multiple H1 tags were found on individual asset pages (one in the global header and one in the asset details section).
    *   *Fix:* Implemented a logic to hide the global header H1 when a page-specific H1 is provided.
*   **Metadata:**
    *   *Issue:* Missing canonical tags and Twitter Cards.
    *   *Fix:* Added dynamic canonical tags and comprehensive Twitter Card metadata to `main.php`.
*   **URLs:**
    *   *Finding:* URLs are clean and SEO-friendly (e.g., `/gold/18ayar`).
    *   *Improvement:* Centralized URL generation to ensure consistency.

### Technical SEO
*   **Sitemap:**
    *   *Issue:* The sitemap only included the home page and used a hardcoded `localhost` URL.
    *   *Fix:* Refactored `site/sitemap.php` to dynamically include all active categories and items with proper priorities and change frequencies.
*   **Structured Data (JSON-LD):**
    *   *Improvement:* Added `BreadcrumbList` for all pages, `FAQPage` for pages with FAQ sections, and `FinancialProduct` for individual assets to improve Rich Snippets.
*   **Robots.txt:**
    *   *Fix:* Updated the Sitemap URL to be relative, ensuring it works across different domains/environments.
